# cpp notes by wang chao 
The goal of this cpp notes is to form a general framework that can be used to link different parts of cpp knowledge that I encounter during the work. The framework is the combination of udecity nanodegree course and the c++ primer (edition 5).
The most important principle is that making things done and no hesitatation about the format, which can be refacted anytime.
